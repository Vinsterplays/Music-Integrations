# Music Integrations

<cg>Music Integrations</c> allows you to easily control external music players from the game using an <cl>integrated overlay accessible from a configurable keybind</c>.

There is also an <cl>automatic playback toggle</c> option that will automatically <cl>toggle playback when playtesting</c> in the editor or entering a level.

The windows version of the mod supports <cl>every*</c> external media player while other platforms (like MacOS and Linux via Wine) only support Spotify as of now (with other platforms planned).

## Special thanks to:
- [Prevter](https://github.com/Prevter), for creating the label class used in the overlay
- [Eclipse Menu](https://github.com/EclipseMenu/EclipseMenu), for providing all the fonts used in the overlay
