# Music Integrations

Automatically toggles the playback of music playing through external media players (Youtube, Spotify, etc.) when music is playing ingame. You can access the overlay to quickly toggle auto playback or control the media player.

<co>HOLD **ALT** TO ACCESS OVERLAY!</co>

While support for other platforms is planned, currently this mod is <cr>only available on Windows</cr>, sorry!

## Special thanks to:
- [Prevter](https://github.com/Prevter), for creating the label class used in the overlay
- [Eclipse Menu](https://github.com/EclipseMenu/EclipseMenu), for providing all the fonts used in the overlay
