# Music Integrations

Have you ever wanted to listen to your own music in the editor while not having to click off GD to pause your music when playtesting? This mod is for you! This mod will toggle music, videos, media (pretty much anything the pause button on your keyboard would do) automatically! Spotify and Youtube are confirmed to work, but many other types of media should work!

HOLD **ALT** TO ACCESS OVERLAY!

While support for other platforms is planned, currently this mod is only available on Windows, sorry!
